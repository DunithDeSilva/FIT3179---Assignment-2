            <h2>Population Vs Poverty</h2>
            <p>More than 40 percent of the global poor live in economies affected by fragility, conflict and violence, and that number is expected to rise to 67 percent in the next decade. Those economies have just 10 percent of the world’s population.
              Middle-income countries such as India and Nigeria will be significantly affected; middle-income countries may be home to 82% of the new poor.
              We can see that the poorest countries are mainly in the african continent and each of the african countires have a very low populaation. but when combined is alot and their growth rate is the highest

        <h1>Population Vs Annual Income</h1>
        <p>Income is measured at the household level, as the sum from all different sources accruing over a certain period of time. Wages are only one of these sources. Other sources include income from self-employment, income from capital and state transfers, such as social security. 
           In developed countries, wages represent the largest source of income - up to 70 or 80 per cent of total pre-tax and post-transfers income - for households with at least one member in the labour force. In emerging and developing economies, the contribution of wages to household income is smaller, ranging from about 50 to 60 per cent in Argentina or Brazil to about 40 percent in Peru and 30 per cent in Vietnam.  
           Hence higher wages are one part of the multiple components of a strategy to reduce poverty or inequality. The creation of wage employment (as opposed to other types of employment, like self-employment) and fiscal redistribution through taxes and social transfers also play a key role.

        <h1>Population Vs Health Expenditure % of GDP</h1>
        <p>
          Poor health would reduce a household’s capacity to earn income and accumulate wealth by 
          limiting work, raising medical expenses and reducing savings. Individuals affected by certain 
          diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, may never develop the capacity to earn 
          enough income to get out of the illness–poverty trap. This point was well recognized by the 
          Commission on Macroeconomics and Health. Moreover, economists, especially those who work in 
          sustainable economic growth theory, have increasingly recognized health as a form of human capital.
           As such, better health increases the productivity of other forms of capital and it contributes to 
           economic growth. Healthier children have higher rates of school attendance and improved cognitive
            development which lead to a higher rate of return on education and makes investment in education 
            more attractive.  Therefore we can see the countries with low health expenditure are the ones with 
            the highest poverty
